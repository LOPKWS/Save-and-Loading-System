This is a very basic attempt a creating a user and then accessing it later
through a data base. I tried to encrypt the password but I didn't find
anything that worked. If you look at the package.json you will see all the
attempts I made with different encryption packages. On the login page I only
check the password not the user name witch wouldn't be difficult to
implement I just wasn't focused on it. Any advice on any part of this
project will be much appreciated, especially with any details about
encryption or running the server on a local ip address without changing
the base server from express to something else.
